What is GKLog?

GKLog is a console-based program made to run with 'tail -f' over a pipe ('|')
or to get specific lines from a log. It makes user-defined patterns
and sub-patterns containing lines colored with a user-defined color.


How do I compile it?

Just enter it's dir and type 'make'. It should build correctly.
Then with root run 'make install' to install it to your system and to create the
initialization script.


How do I use it?

You'll want to use it with tail... just do:
tail -f /var/log/syslog | gklog - -o /dev/null

(change /dev/null to a file to write a diferent log or run it as root
to let it log on /var/log/gklog, it's default)


or you may also make it create a own log from a log file itself just do:
gklog <log's_name>

you may also tell it where to write it's log (there's a default, that is
/var/log/gklog):
gklog <log's_name> -o <file_name>

and tell it not to show lines that have none of the pattern+sub-pattern:
gklog <logs_name> -r


How do I set up new rules and colors?

You must edit /etc/gklog.rules. Your package should contain a default file. It
will be copied to that location on 'make install'. It has a extremely disciplined
format:

Pattern&Sub Pattern=color

it should contain the same number of lines and rules. You may, since version 
0.5 write comments using the '#' symbol, blank lines are still not permitted.
In the end of the file it should not cause damage, but if you put a blank line
at the beginning you'll be disabling the color features.

color can be:

	color name to use
	
	green
	blue
	cyan
	red
	purple
	brown
	gray2 (the default for linux console)
	gray1 (dark grey)
	bblue (all the following 'b' beginning colors are bright)
	bgreen
	bcyan
	bred
	bpurple
	yellow
	white
